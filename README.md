This repository contains an example of a common ActionScript 3 error related to implicit type coercion.  The `bug.as` file demonstrates the error, while `bugSolution.as` provides a corrected version. The error occurs when the compiler attempts to implicitly convert a Number to a String without an explicit cast. This can lead to unexpected behavior or runtime errors.  The solution shows how to use explicit type casting to avoid this issue and ensure type safety.
